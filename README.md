# My workshops

**A collection of workshops I’ve delivered on NLP, LLMs, RAG, Qdrant and related AI topics across various events and bootcamps.**

## 01.GDG Carthage bootcamp
In this bootcamp we go through NLP and RAG.

### 1.1 [Introduction to NLP and LLMs](01-Intro-to-NLP-and-LLMs/)
**In this workshop, we will learn what NLP and LLM are and implement a simple NLP pipeline to from cleaning to word embeddings of text.**

* What is NLP & its techniques
* What are LLMs?
* Attention mechanism

### 1.2 [Introduction to RAG](02-intro-to-RAG/)
In this workshop , we will learn about: 

* Hallucinations & Solutions
* RAG and fine-tuning
* What is RAG?
* How does RAG work & its components
* RAG in practice

## 02. [GDGoC SUP'COM bootcamp](nlp_meets_genai_llms_rag/)
**As a component of the GENAI bootcamp organized by GDGoC SUP'COM & ISAMM.**
## 03. [GDGoC EPI & FSS Intro to RAG and techniques](intro-rag-and-techniques-epi-fss/)
**This workshop is one of the sessions in the FSS & EPI GENAI bootcamp.**
## 04. [GO DATA SCIENCE hackathon (GODS 4.0)](Into-to-NLP-GODS-4.0/)
**Delivered as part of the GODS 4.0 hackathon, this workshop covers:**
* NLP & techniques
* Data preprocessing techniques
* Building a simple text classification model 

## 05. [Data Overflow workshop](Intro-RAG-Data-Overflow/)
**This workshop is a part of the Data Overflow bootcamp which focuses basically on building a chatbot that talk on your behalf (from your resume informations)**


## 06. AINS 3.0 RAG Talk 
**This talk was part of the AINS 3.0 event organized by CS IEEE INSAT which covers how we could enhance RAG pipelines using Qdrant as a vector store.**
You will find all the materials in this repo [Building Smarter RAG Pipelines with Qdrant](https://github.com/Goodnight77/Just-RAG/tree/main/AINS_qdrant_talk)



## Resources 
At the end of each workshop presentation in the Slides folder, you will find a set of resources to help you get started.
* [Introduction to Generative AI : course from Google cloud](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths/118)
* more to be added soon...
